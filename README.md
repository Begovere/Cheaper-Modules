# Cheaper-Modules
A repository for the "Cheaper Modules" modification for the game Factorio. This mod is also available for download via the official mod page (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/CheaperModules) or the download function in the game client.

# Installation
I recommend to perform the installation automatically using the download function of the client. If you want a manual installation, please follow these instructions:

Download the "CheaperModules_(version).zip" file after replacing "(version)" with the version number you want to use. The latest version is always available in the root directory of this repository, older versions are provided in "/old-releases/".

Place the zip archive you downloaded in the "mods" directory in your user data directory according to https://wiki.factorio.com/Application_directory#User_data_directory. The default values are:

Windows: %appdata%\Factorio

MacOSX: ~/Library/Application Support/factorio

Linux distributions: ~/.factorio

Once these steps have been followed, the mod should be activated the next time you start the game.

# What will be changed by this mod?
This mod reduces the price and crafting time of modules.

Tier 1 modules still cost 5 green curcuits and 5 red curcuits (the Vanilla values) but only 10 second crafting time.

Tier 2 modules cost 2 Tier 1 modules of the same type (red and blue curcuits removed from the recipe) and have 10 second crafting time.

Tier 3 modules cost 2 Tier 2 modules of the same type (red and blue curcuits removed from the recipe) and have 10 second crafting time.


This applies to the 3 vanilla modules (Productivity, Efficiency, Speed). Modules from other mods won't be affected by this mod.
